# Waze User Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes user behavior data from the Waze app to understand patterns, identify outliers, and explore churn rates. The analysis includes visualizations like box plots, histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots to derive insights from the dataset.

## 📊 Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions of key metrics (`sessions`, `drives`, `device` usage, etc.).
- **Outlier Handling**: Imputes extreme values using the 95th percentile threshold.
- **Churn Analysis**: Examines churn rates based on driving behavior (`km_per_driving_day`, `driving_days`).
- **Derived Metrics**: Computes ratios like `monthly_drives_per_session_ratio` and `percent_sessions_in_last_month`.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pandas matplotlib seaborn

  
# Project Idea: Waze User Behavior Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze Waze app usage data to:
1. Understand user engagement patterns.
2. Identify factors influencing churn (user attrition).
3. Derive actionable insights to improve retention.

## 🔍 Key Questions
1. How are user sessions and drives distributed? Are there outliers?
2. What’s the churn rate based on driving frequency or distance?
3. Do users with more recent activity (`percent_sessions_in_last_month`) churn less?

## 📊 Analysis Approach
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Median, percentiles, and distributions.
- **Visual EDA**: Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - `km_per_driving_day`: Normalizes distance by activity.
  - `monthly_drives_per_session_ratio`: Measures drive frequency per session.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Outlier Handling**: Values above the 95th percentile are capped to reduce skew.
- **Visualization**: Seaborn/Matplotlib for clear, interpretable plots.
- **Modular Code**: Helper functions like `histogrammer()` and `outlier_imputer()` for reusability.

## 💡 Potential Extensions
- Predict churn using machine learning (logistic regression, Random Forest).
- Segment users by behavior (e.g., "high-distance drivers", "infrequent users").
- Analyze temporal trends (e.g., usage decay over months).

## 📚 Dataset Notes
- Ensure `waze_dataset.csv` includes columns like `sessions`, `drives`, `label` (churn status), and `device`.
- Missing data? The script assumes clean data; preprocess if needed.
